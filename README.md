# python-east-africa-data-analysis
This group project is an exploratory analysis of East and South Africa data from the World Bank based on specific metrics, making use of visual and statistical tools in Python.

Additionally, my team developped a strategy for missing values and potential outliers and shared our findings a 9-12 minute presentation in front of the masters of business analytics student body.
 

Analysis and Presentation

My team augmented the datasets with additional data about the region and cited valid sources. Additionally, my team introduced unique characteristics of the East/South African region. We also made comparisons to other regions and/or world averages.
