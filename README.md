# python-east-africa-data-analysis

This group project is an exploratory analysis of the demographic and socio-economic data in East and South Africa provided by the World Bank. 
The project imports, cleans, visualizes, and presents data in a method that is easy for any user to digest and understand. The external libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Based on the analysis, the team delivered insights on macroeconomics (GDP vs Employment) and population (fertility rate). The team also explored business questions surrounding electricity data. 

Lastly, we shared our findings a 12 minute presentation in front of the masters of business analytics student body.
