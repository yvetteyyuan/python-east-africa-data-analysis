# python-east-africa-data-analysis
This group project is an exploratory analysis of East and South Africa data from the World Bank based on specific metrics, making use of visual and statistical tools in Python. The external libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
The project demonstrates the foundations of Data Science in order to import, study, visualize, and present the raw data in a method that is easy for any user to digest and understand.

First, the raw data in excel will be loaded into a Python (Pandas) dataframe.

Second, there will be some data exploration. My team identify the missing data and developped a strategy for missing values and potential outliers. The team augmented the datasets with additional data about the region and cited valid sources. 

Third, the data will be analyzed, where the team generated insights on macroeconomics (GDP vs Employment) and population (fertility rate). The team also explored business questions surrounding electricity data. Additionally, my team introduced unique characteristics of the East/South African region. We also made comparisons to other regions and/or world averages.

Lastly, we shared our findings a 12 minute presentation in front of the masters of business analytics student body.
